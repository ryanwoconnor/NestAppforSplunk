Nest App for Splunk Documentation
====================

Installation:
---------------------
To install this App, you can can navigate to “Manage Apps” in your Splunk installation and then “Browse More Apps”. From there you can find the Nest App for Splunk and install it. 

Distributed Environment requirements: In a distributed environment, this App is only needed on your Search Head. 

Configuration:
---------------------
You do not need to do anything to configure this app to view data from your Nest devices. If you’d like to see information about outside temperature, you can follow the instructions for the Weather Underground section below. 

Weather Underground:
---------------------
One optional configuration step you can take is to configure the TA-wunderground app. This will allow for some dashboards to populate different panels. For instructions on installing that app visit https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1257/

If you want to integrate that data into the Nest App for Splunk, you'll need to update the lookup table named **home_view_city**. 

There are two relevant fields in here:
*name* - this is the name of your nest account. It can be found in your data under the “name” field. 
*city* - this is the City configured in the wunderground TA. 

Running the app:
---------------------
Simply click the app in the App Drop Down in Splunk. 


Troubleshooting
---------------------

There are two reasons you may not see data in the dashboard right away. 

1. You simply just haven't had any data come into Splunk yet. You can attempt to interact with your thermostat in order to generate some data. 
2. Some dashboards will only populate if you have certain nest devices. For example if you don't have a Nest Thermostat, that dashboard won't be relevant to you.
